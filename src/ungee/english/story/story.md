Title: The Clever Fox and the Foolish Crow

Once upon a time, a clever fox and a foolish crow lived in the same forest. One day, the crow found a piece of delicious cheese and flew up to a tree branch to enjoy it. The fox, seeing the crow with the cheese, came up with a cunning plan.

The fox approached the tree and said, "Hello, dear crow! Your feathers are so beautiful, and I've heard your voice is even more enchanting. Would you please sing a song for me?"

The foolish crow, flattered by the fox's words, opened its beak to sing. As soon as it did, the cheese fell from its beak and into the waiting jaws of the fox. The crow realized its mistake and felt foolish.

聪明的狐狸和愚蠢的乌鸦

从前，有一只聪明的狐狸和一只愚蠢的乌鸦住在同一个森林里。一天，乌鸦发现了一块美味的奶酪，飞到树枝上享用。狐狸看到乌鸦带着奶酪，想出了一个狡猾的计划。

狐狸走近树下，说道：“你好，亲爱的乌鸦！你的羽毛真漂亮，我听说你的声音更加迷人。你能为我唱首歌吗？”

愚蠢的乌鸦被狐狸的话所吹捧，张开嘴巴准备唱歌。就在这时，奶酪从它的嘴巴掉了下来，落入了等待已久的狐狸的口中。乌鸦意识到自己的错误，感到非常愚蠢。
